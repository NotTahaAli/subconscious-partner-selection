# Subconscious Partner Selection

A thoughtful tool designed to help you understand your deeper preferences in potential life partners. Rather than using rigid questionnaires or superficial criteria, this application uses AI-guided personality comparisons to reveal what truly resonates with you in meaningful relationships.

## About

This project takes a uniquely human approach to understanding relationship preferences. Instead of treating personalities as abstract concepts, it presents potential partners as real people with authentic qualities and characteristics. Through a series of thoughtful comparisons, you'll discover patterns in the types of people you naturally connect with most deeply.

## Features

- **Natural Comparisons**: Meet and compare different personalities in a way that feels like genuine human interaction
- **Personalized Insights**: Gain deep understanding of your relationship preferences through AI-generated insights
- **Meaningful Traits**: Focus on qualities that matter in real relationships, not just personality categories
- **Privacy-First**: Your preferences are stored locally in your browser
- **Adaptive Learning**: Uses the ELO algorithm to continuously refine understanding of your preferences
